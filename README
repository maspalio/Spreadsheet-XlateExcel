Spreadsheet-XlateExcel

This modules triggers a callback subroutine on each row of an Excel
spreadsheet.

Wrote this simple module because I was fed up from writing the same
boilerplate code ever when I had to mine spreadsheets for data.

Operates on every sheet unless a given sheet is targeted by name,
RE inclusion or RE exclusion.

Operates on every column unless targeted by column head name or
RE (inclusion).

Code is hosted on github (http://github.com/maspalio/Spreadsheet-XlateExcel).

This is v0.02_02 or Spreadsheet::XlateExcel module.
